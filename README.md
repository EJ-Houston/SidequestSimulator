# SidequestSimulator

My first ever game!

Progress will be slow as after the required school year was completed and submitted Sidequest Simulator has turned into a personal side project, along with many other projects that will certianly take priority at times. 

As of updating this Sidequest Simulator is updated to Pre-Alpha 0.4, with most core components mapped out and a basic ui layout set down.
There's instructions in the game itself, but I'll add a detailed list below. 


CORE INSTRUCTIONS
"ESC" will pause the game and bring up the menu page. You can navigate to Start, Help, and Quit. The Options node is not available at this time.
Primary movement is W (Up), A (Right), S (Down), and D (Left).
To speak to NPCs press "F", you can use "F" or Enter to continue the dialog. Use your mouse to choose dialog options.
To attack enemies press Right Click. Enemies are taken out in 3-5 swipes, and at this time they do not fight back.
To pick berries (and in the future, interact with items), press "E". This will remove the berries from the bush and count as one(1) towards your quest goal.

QUEST JOURNAL INSTRUCTIONS
Press the closed tab button in the top right corner to open the quest journal. (In the future this button will change to alert you when a new quest has been activated.)
If you have a quest active, there will be a panel on the right telling you to select a quest. If no quests are active, it'll tell you that there are no quests to select.
Select either "ACTIVE" or "COMPLETED" to view your active and completed quests. There will reveal a list of quest buttons, if selected, a panel will appear on the right side detailing the requirements to complete the quest. (In the future the ACTIVE and COMPLETED tabs will be more distinguished for less player confusion.)
