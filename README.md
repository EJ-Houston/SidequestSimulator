# SidequestSimulator

My first ever game!

Progress will be slow as after the required school year was completed and submitted Sidequest Simulator has turned into a personal side project,
along with many other projects that will certianly take priority at times. 

As of updating this Sidequest Simulator is updated to Pre-Alpha 0.4, with most core components mapped out and a basic ui layout set down.
There's instructions in the game itself, but I'll add a detailed list below.
